When "Cephei" is installed, it takes a look at Preferences and adversely affects other preferences.

Recently, there have been many Tweaks that use "Cephei", possibly referring to Nepeta's open source.

I want to show you how to make a simple configuration screen that works even with sandbox without "Cephei".
